Glaucoma Detection Using AI & IoT
An AI-powered IoT-based glaucoma detection system leveraging Raspberry Pi, a Camera Module, an Advanced Ultrasonic Sensor, and LED Indicators for real-time eye screening. The system captures and analyzes eye images using deep learning (CNNs) and provides instant feedback, helping in early glaucoma detection to prevent vision loss.

Features
âœ… AI-based image analysis using TensorFlow/PyTorch & OpenCV
âœ… IoT-enabled real-time monitoring with Raspberry Pi & ESP Module
âœ… Ultrasonic Sensor for accurate eye positioning before image capture
âœ… LED indicators for instant diagnosis (Green: Normal, Red: Potential Glaucoma)
âœ… Google Cloud Services integration for remote diagnostics
âœ… FastAPI & MQTT/HTTP for efficient data communication
âœ… Portable design with 4-hour battery backup (2000mAh)
